<li>As a member of the Climate, Ocean, and Sea Ice Modeling (COSIM) team at LANL, I have implemented the <a href="http://cnls.lanl.gov/~petersen/petersen_alpha.pdf">LANS-alpha turbulence model in the POP ocean model</a>.  Simulations with LANS-alpha capture some of the
most important features of high resolution ocean modeling at lower
resolution.
<li>My work in the <a href="http://cnls.lanl.gov/~petersen/petersen_planetary_disk.pdf">dynamics of protoplanetary disks</a> investigates the conditions required to form and maintain vortices in these gas disks that encircle young stars, and highlight the roll of the baroclinic feedback.
